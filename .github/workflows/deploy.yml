# Things to try:
# ( ) His source code is a little diff. Try his version instead:
# ( ) Can we accomodate for there being no version property?
# ( ) What did he mean by the "out filename could be arranged like _windows.zip"
# ( ) Should we include the version in the zip file too?
# ( ) Try out the zip code as well.
# (X) What does the versioning code do anyway?
  # $newVersion = [System.Version]::new($csprojVersion.Major, 0, ${{ github.run_number }})
  # If your .csproj file currently has a version 1.2.3 and this is the 42nd run of your GitHub Action,
  # $csprojVersion.Major will be 1, and ${{ github.run_number }} will be 42.
  # The new version created will be 1.0.42.
# (x) How is this version different: https://domburf.medium.com/updating-the-version-number-in-your-net-build-pipeline-128f9fd5b7e
  # Its the same except for the fact that he takes advantage of environment variables
  # Let me try the environment variables version
# ( ) Should the versioning go in the validate or deploy?
# ( ) Make deploy and validate more closely resemble your original
